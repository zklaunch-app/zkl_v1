# zkl_v1
V1 Gov Token


The code presented in this repository is the first version of the zkLaunch token control. Standard methods are implemented such as buying, setting prices, etc. Additionally, a 'claim' function has been added, which includes whitelisting through Merkle trees. This version of the contract has been deployed on Mainnet and is stable.
